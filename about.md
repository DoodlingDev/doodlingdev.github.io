title: About
---

I am a Web Developer, formerly a theatre professional and prop construction wizard who began learning fabrication and sculpture in my study of Interdisciplinary Electronic Art. From early on, I was interested in creating experiences for those that interacted with my art, and used technological tools to achieve them.

I am continually curious about how humans interact with technology. I built props that would combine electronics with circus performance, and worked with the most cutting-edge performers in that emerging field. My decision of new project was often based on the question “will I learn a new skill here?” I seek out new challenges that are outside of my comfort zone, and endeavor to never be afraid to tackle a situation I haven’t yet faced.

Finding myself more invested in the electronic half of my entertainment career drew me to explore software in depth for my own learning, and eventually to Dev Bootcamp for a professional education.

The world is moving more and more online and becoming increasingly integrated with tech in everyday life. It’s that wave moving towards the internet and connectivity that I strive to tap into. Creating intuitive, enjoyable experiences with native web applications that can make lives more fulfilled and joyful.

I am a fan of the oxford comma.
