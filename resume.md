### UL, llc
#### Software Developer

* The Digital Product Innovation team has a varied portfolio of applications under the UL software umbrella, including modern re-platforming of legacy engineering applications and multi-million dollar revenue generating customer facing applications.

* As a front-end specialist, I facilitate code quality guidelines and style guides as well as their practical application, participate in high-level architecture creation of new projects, see to it that company-wide design and UI\UX standards are correctly implemented, maintain and oversee relevant component libraries, and mentor those developers on the team whose skills in our front end stack have not yet matured.

### Dev Bootcamp
#### Mentor and remote Teaching Assistant

* The Dev Bootcamp program began with 9 weeks of remote learning (known as Phase 0) to build strong fundamentals in the languages and skills that will be utilized in the on-site intensive coursework.

* My role was to mentor and assist those who were newer to the programming craft through thorough code review and hour-long guided pair programming sessions led over video chat and collaborative software editors. Technologies covered included git, html5 & css, SQL, Ruby and Javascript.
