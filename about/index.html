  <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>
  <p>I am a Web Developer, formerly a theatre professional and prop construction wizard who began learning fabrication and sculpture in my study of Interdisciplinary Electronic Art. From early on, I was interested in creating experiences for those that interacted with my art, and used technological tools to achieve them.</p>

<p>I am continually curious about how humans interact with technology. I built props that would combine electronics with circus performance, and worked with the most cutting-edge performers in that emerging field. My decision of new project was often based on the question “will I learn a new skill here?” I seek out new challenges that are outside of my comfort zone, and endeavor to never be afraid to tackle a situation I haven’t yet faced.</p>

<p>Finding myself more invested in the electronic half of my entertainment career drew me to explore software in depth for my own learning, and eventually to Dev Bootcamp for a professional education.</p>

<p>The world is moving more and more online and becoming increasingly integrated with tech in everyday life. It’s that wave moving towards the internet and connectivity that I strive to tap into. Creating intuitive, enjoyable experiences with native web applications that can make lives more fulfilled and joyful.</p>

<p>I am a fan of the oxford comma.</p>
